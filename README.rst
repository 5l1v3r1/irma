IRMA: Incident Response & Malware Analysis 
------------------------------------------

IRMA is an asynchronous and customizable analysis system for suspicious files.
This repository is a subproject of IRMA and contains the source code for IRMA's
Brain, which is a python-based application that schedules analysis jobs
requested by the Frontend for one or multiple Probes. Thanks for checking it
out.

Documentation
`````````````

All documentation is in the ``docs`` directory. If you are just getting
started, here is how we recommend you read the docs:

1. First, build the documentation with ``sphinx`` (in the ``docs`` directory,
   do ``make html``).
2. Next, open the documentation in your favorite web browser. The documentation
   is generated in ``_build/html``. You can open, for instance,
   ``_build/html/index.html`` as a starting point.
3. Go through the documentation.

We are trying to do your best to update the documentation regularly. If you
find any problems in the documentation, or think they should be clarified in
any way, please take 30 seconds to fill out a `ticket
<https://github.com/quarkslab/irma-brain/issues>`_.
