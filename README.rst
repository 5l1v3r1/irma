Documentation
`````````````

All documentation is in the ``docs`` directory. If you are just getting
started, here is how we recommend you read the docs:

1. First, build the documentation with ``sphinx`` (in the ``docs`` directory,
   do ``make html``).
2. Next, open the documentation in your favorite web browser. The documentation
   is generated in ``_build/html``. You can open, for instance,
   ``_build/html/index.html`` as a starting point.
3. Go through the documentation.

We are trying to do your best to update the documentation regularly. If you
find any problems in the documentation, or think they should be clarified in
any way, please take 30 seconds to fill out a `ticket
<https://github.com/quarkslab/irma-frontend/issues>`_.
